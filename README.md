# Grey Hack Scripts
A collection of scripts made for [Grey Hack](https://store.steampowered.com/app/605230/Grey_Hack/).

## Available scripts
- `CoreKit` - A collection of small utilities and helpers. All my scripts will generally include this one except for PrepKit.
- `PrepKit` - A hybrid C-style preprocessor for GreyScript.
- `AirKit` - A simple script to quickly obtain and connect to a vulnerable wifi network
- `AirScan` - A simple script to quickly scan the network for devices with open ports

## Installing scripts
Note that all the scripts on this repository should be compiled using the prepkit script.
Simply compile prepkit normally using the game's code editor, and the just use the prepkit command like so: `prepkit AirKit.src -o /bin`
